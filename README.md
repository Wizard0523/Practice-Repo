# Practice-Repo
a repository for me to practice git

4/27/2024
I played Git Tac Toe to learn git and github. I learned to clone a repository, add changes, commit the changes, push the changes, and to pull the changes to another computer. 

I also learned about branches. I learned to navigate to an old commit, and how to create a new branch from the old commit.

commands:
git checkout <commit ID>  -- switches to old commit <br>
git checkout -b <name>  -- creates a new branch <br>
